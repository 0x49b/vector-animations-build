# Triggering an Animation

If you are interested in triggering an animation :

Make sure you have the name of the animation you'd like to see. Typically this can be found in the story ticket or ask one of the animators and they can provide you with the name you will need.

Please remember - some groups have more than one animation so you will need a list of all animations for that particular feature. 

 

Go to webpage on your computer and connect to your Vector.

ip:8888 → consolvars → BehaviorBootLoader Tab → 'Set active mode and boot mode to DevDoNothing' → SAVE console vars → go to Animation Tab → paste in the anim name to PlayAnimationByName → Press "Call"


Please note this puts Vector in a state where he does not do any behaviors except what you force trigger him to do.
